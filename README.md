> Setup and manage GUNBOT 3.2 on Linux.

If you want to setup a brand new Debian or Ubuntu VPS to run GUNBOT, just log into your new VPS as root and run this install script:

```bash
curl -qsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeerK0in/generator-gunbot/master/install.sh | bash -- && exec bash
```
After the setup run:
```bash
ginit
```

That script will 
 * update the system (`apt upgrade`), 
 * install node 7.x, 
 * install required tools (`yo`, `pm2`, `unzip`), 
 * install the GUNBOT 3.2, 
 * creates some handy aliases,
 * install this generator-gunbot

**Aliases**

The installer also sets up some aliases to do more with less. :)

- `gcd`: Go to the folder GUNBOT is installed
- `gadd`: Use the generator to add a new pair _(*)_
- `gl`: Get a list of all running GUNBOTs
- `glog [botname or number]`: Shows the log of the selected bot (use `gl` to get name) 
- `gstop [botname or number]`: Stops a running bot (use `gl` to get name) 
- `gstart [botname or number]`: Starts a stopped bot (use `gl` to get name) 

_(*)For now `gadd` will use the same settings as defined in the first run of the generator. A next version will allow you to set specific strategies for new trade pairs._


**Updates**

To update follow these steps:cdg  

1. Login to your server.
2. Run this update script
```bash
curl -qsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BeerK0in/generator-gunbot/master/update.sh | bash --
```
3. Run `ginit` again to start all bots with delay
```bash
ginit
```
4. Press ENTER for every question (it will use your last settings)
5. _[optional]_ Press ENTER on the conflict of ALLPAIRS _(*)_
6. Wait till all bots are started.
7. _[optional]_ If you have changed some configs manually, please copy them from the backup folder back into the gunbot folder:
```bash
cp /opt/gunbot-backup-<NUMBER>/poloniex-BTC_XXX-config.js /opt/gunbot/
```

_(*)_ The conflict could happen if you hav an older version of the generator, because the default settings have changed a bit.
In that case it is very likely you see this question. Just press ENTER:
```
conflict ALLPAIRS-params.js
? Overwrite ALLPAIRS-params.js? (Ynaxdh)
```
